Subject: [PATCH] tg_rename

Going to implement "tg rename OLD NEW".

For the beginning -- a simple shortcut to do this only for leaves, i.e.,
branches with no dependents.

As for the complete implementation, 
see [Sketch out what tg rename OLD NEW would do](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/git-version-control/AG9AIk3DMBM)
as proposed by Thomas Schwinge and acknowledged by David Bremner
and Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig on 2010-01-27 in #topgit (freenode).
