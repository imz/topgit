Subject: [PATCH] tg_rebase

Going to implement "tg rebase BASE [CURRENT] [--onto NEW]"
-- a convenient shortcut when prettifying your local history.

Of course, it is allowed only for leaves, 
otherwise it would spoil dependent branches.
(This problem is hardly solvable even theoretically in a nice way,
unlike in the case of tg-rename.)

Remember that rebasing spoils published history!

The plan is to make it a shortcut on top of tg-rename
(and creating temporary branch names, and using git-rebase).
